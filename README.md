## <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/intermediate-perl-2nd/9781449343781/">Structure of This Book</a> 

### Chapter 1,
Introduction An introduction to the material. 

### Chapter 2, 
Using Modules Use Perl’s core modules as well \
as modules from other people. We’re going to \
show you how to create your own modules later \
in the book, but until we do you can still use \
modules you already have. 

### Chapter 3, 
Intermediate Foundations Pick up some intermediate \
Perl skills you’ll need for the rest of the book. 

### Chapter 4, 
Introduction to References Introduce a level of \
redirection to allow the same code to operate on \
different sets of data. Chapter 5, References and \
Scoping Learn how Perl manages to keep track of \
pointers to data, and read an introduction to \
anonymous data structures and autovivification. 

### Chapter 6, 
Manipulating Complex Data Structures Create, access, \
and print arbitrarily deep and nested data structures \
including ar-rays of arrays and hashes of hashes. 

### Chapter 7, 
Subroutine References Capture behavior as an anonymous \
subroutine that you create dynamically and execute later. 

### Chapter 8, 
Filehandle References Store filehandles in \
scalar variables that you can easily pass around your \
program or store in data structures. 

### Chapter 9, 
Regular Expression References Compile regular expressions \
without immediately applying them, and use them as building \
blocks for larger patterns. 

### Chapter 10, 
Practical Reference Tricks Sorting complex operations, \
the Schwartzian Transform, and working with recur-sively \
defined data.

### Chapter 11, 
Building Larger Programs Build larger programs by separating \
code into separate files and namespaces. 

### Chapter 12, 
Creating Your Own Perl Distribution Create a Perl \
distribution as your first step toward object-oriented programming. 

### Chapter 13, 
Introduction to Objects Work with classes, method calls, inheritance, \
and overriding. Chapter 14, Introduction to Testing Start to test your \
modules so you find problems with the code as you create it. 

### Chapter 15, 
Objects with Data Add per instance data, including constructors, getters, \
and setters. 

### Chapter 16, 
Some Advanced Object Topics Use multiple inheritance, \
automatic methods, and references to filehandles. 

### Chapter 17, 
Exporter How use works, how we can decide what to export, \
and how we can create our own import routines. 

### Chapter 18, 
Object Destruction Add behavior to an object that is going \
away, including object persistence. 

### Chapter 19, 
Introduction to Moose Moose is an object framework available \
on CPAN. 

### Chapter 20, 
Advanced Testing Test complex aspects of code \
and metacode things such as documentation and test coverage. 

### Chapter 21, 
Contributing to CPAN Share your work with the world by uploading \
it to CPAN. 

### Appendix, 
Exercise Answers \
Where to go to get answers.
